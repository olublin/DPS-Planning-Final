>what is in the repo?
This repository contains the necessary scripts and datasets to filter residential developments for relevancy, generate student generation from filtered new developments in Durham County, and apply this to **CFLP linear optimization** and **Gravity** models for optimal boundary and site generation for new public school siting locations

The scripts are within their own folders, and all required input data is within the *data* folder in the repository
